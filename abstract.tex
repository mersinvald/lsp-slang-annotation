Nowadays we have a lot of mature toolkits and integrated development environments for a set of widely used programming languages
evolved through years to fulfill needs of the most of software development industry.

However, such software products are highly complex and often have a monolithic architecture, usually standalone
from the language compiler infrastructure which makes it hard to replace key components or implement support for additional languages.

In this paper we will see how conventional compilers have been architectured and what complications
this consequently brought to modern IDE implementations, review the modern approach to compiler construction and implement a flexible
distributed integrated development environment with the \\Language Server Protocol, for a multi paradigm SLang\cite{Zouev2017} programming language.
