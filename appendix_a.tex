\section{Akkadia: origin of the name}
\label{trivia:akkadia}

The name of the project was chosen to be Akkadia because of the modularity of this Language Server
and a power to implement several languages support through it's module system.

Akkadia takes it`s routes from the name of an antient Akkadian language, the common language common language for all men
as the legends say, that had two dialects: Assyrian and Babilonian.
By the legend, the latter dialect was destroed by the god by making people to confuse words, letters and rules, effectively creating hundreds of languages,
because was mad at people for building the Babylon Tower.

Akkadia aims to unify different languages under one framework again.
